# WebHook Plugin Reference

## Description

Allows the sending of WebHooks. At the moment, only slack application/json format is supported. See https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks.

- Top tip: Append /slack to the end of a Discord webhook url for it to work.

## Limitations

WebHook credentials need to be in script. This is a bad thing.
